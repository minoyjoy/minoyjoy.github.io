          A recreation of Dungeon 1 in the first Zelda game for the NES and a
          custom level with a new mechanic. For this project, I worked primarily
          on implementing the enemies in the dungeon, including their movement
          and attack logic. I also designed the two puzzles at the end of the
          custom level to showcase how the mechanic could be used to change the
          gameplay of Zelda, as well as implementing logic and modifying sprites
          for the step attack.
